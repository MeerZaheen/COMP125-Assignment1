Since then, I was employed at an engineering firm called CCI-Group. Formerly I was at a 9 month contract with EXP Inc. I was always passionate about evolving products and disruptive technologies and hence why I chose to continue my education at Centennial College as a Software Engineer. Outside of Engineering and technology, I like to play competitive video games, absorb different cultures and enjoy amazing food. I have always had a passion for sports and personal fitness â€“ not only to lead a healthy lifestyle but to bring out my competitive spirit. I live to serve my talents as an engineer, artist and a fitness enthusiast. I create balance in work, play, and community. Also, I want to be the kind of person my cat already thinks I am."

As of now, this custom PC can handle everything thrown at it and there will always be a new upgrade as more and more technology arises.
